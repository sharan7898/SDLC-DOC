# SDLC

## **SDLC**
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. SDLC is a process that consists of a series of planned activities to develop or alter the Software Products

Software Development Life Cycle  is  used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates. 

## **What is SDLC?**

   Software Development Life Cycle, which is a structured approach to the development of software applications. The SDLC process is a series of steps or phases that are followed by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications.


  The SDLC process typically includes the following stages:

  1.**Planning** : This stage involves defining the project scope, goals, and objectives, as well as identifying the resources, risks, and constraints associated with the project.
  2.**Requirements gathering** : In this stage, the requirements for the software application are gathered from stakeholders, including end-users, clients, and other relevant parties.
  3.**Design** : The design stage involves creating a detailed plan for the software application, including the system architecture, database design, and user interface design.
  4.**Development** : During the development stage, the software code is written and the application is built according to the design specifications.
  5.**Testing** : Once the software application is built, it undergoes a series of tests to ensure that it meets the functional, performance, and security requirements.
  6.**Deployment** : The software application is deployed to the production environment, and the end-users begin to use it.
  7.**Maintenance** : After the software application is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance, updates, and support to ensure that it continues to meet the changing needs of the users.

## SDLC Models

 There are various software development life cycle models defined and       designed which are followed during the software development process. These models are also referred as Software Development Process Models". Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development.

 Here,are the some important models, 

 1.**WaterFlow Model**
 2.**RAD Model**
 3.**Spiral Model**
 4.**V-Model**
 5.**Incremental model**
 6.**Agile Model**
 7.**Iterative Model**
 8.**Big-Bang Model**
 9.**Prototype Model**


### WaterFall Model

The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential model cycle.
In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete.
In this waterfall model, the phases do not overlap.
In The Waterfall approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases.
In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

The sequential phases in Waterfall model are −

1.**Requirement Gathering and analysis** − All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document.

2.**System Design** − The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. This system design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the overall system architecture.




3.**Implementation** − With inputs from the system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing.

4.**Integration and Testing**  − All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.

5.**Deployment of system** − Once the functional and non-functional testing is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.

6.**Maintenance** − There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment

All these phases are cascaded to each other in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards through the phases. The next phase is started only after the defined set of goals are achieved for previous phase and it is signed off, so the name "Waterfall Model".

**Pros of WaterFall Model**

1.Simple and easy to understand and use
2.This model is simple to implement also the number of resources that are required for it is minimal.
3.The requirements are simple and explicitly declared; they remain unchanged during the entire project development.
4.The start and end points for each phase is fixed, which makes it easy to cover progress.
5.The release date for the complete product, as well as its final cost, can be determined before development.
6.It gives easy to control and clarity for the customer due to a strict reporting system.

**Cons of WaterFall Model**

1.In this model, the risk factor is higher, so this model is not suitable for more significant and complex projects.
2.This model cannot accept the changes in requirements during development.
3.It becomes tough to go back to the phase. For example, if the application has now shifted to the testing phase, and there is a change in coding, It becomes tough to go back and change it.
4.Since the testing done at a later stage, it does not allow identifying the     challenges and risks in the earlier phase, so the risk reduction strategy is difficult  to prepare.


### Iterative Model

         In this Model, you can start with some of the software specifications and develop the first version of the software. After the first version if there is a need to change the software, then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration. Every release of the Iterative Model finishes in an exact and fixed period that is called iteration. The Iterative Model allows the accessing earlier phases, in which the variations made respectively. The final output of the project renewed at the end of the SDLC process.


     The Iterative model includes the following phases –

1.**Requirement gathering & analysis** : In this phase, requirements are gathered from customers and check by an analyst whether requirements will fulfil or not. Analyst checks that need will achieve within budget or not. After all of this, the software team skips to the next phase.
2.**Design** : In the design phase, team design the software by the different diagrams like Data Flow diagram, activity diagram, class diagram, state transition diagram, etc.
3.**Implementation** : In the implementation, requirements are written in the coding language and transformed into computer programmes which are called Software.
4.**Testing** : After completing the coding phase, software testing starts using different test methods. There are many test methods, but the most common are white box, black box, and grey box test methods.
5.**Deployment** : After completing all the phases, software is deployed to its work environment.
6.**Review**: In this phase, after the product deployment, review phase is performed to check the behaviour and validity of the developed product. And if there are any error found then the process starts again from the requirement gathering.
7.**Maintenance**: In the maintenance phase, after deployment of the software in the working environment there may be some bugs, some errors or new updates are required. Maintenance involves debugging and new addition options.

**Pros of Iterative Model**

1.Testing and debugging during smaller iteration is easy.
2.A Parallel development can plan.
3.It is easily acceptable to ever-changing needs of the project.
4.Risks are identified and resolved during iteration.
5.Limited time spent on documentation and extra time on designing.


**Cons of Iterative Model**

1.It is not suitable for smaller projects.
2.More Resources may be required.
3.Design can be changed again and again because of imperfect requirements.
4.Requirement changes can cause over budget.
5.Project completion date not confirmed because of changing requirements.
